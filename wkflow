# GitHub Actions workflow: deploy from any branch to the gh-pages branch automatically
# - Triggers on push to any branch and on manual workflow_dispatch
# - If a package.json exists it will run `npm ci && npm run build`
# - Set PUBLISH_DIR (default ./) to the folder you want published (e.g., ./public or ./docs)
# - Uses the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN to push to gh-pages (no extra secret required)
